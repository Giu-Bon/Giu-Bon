## My Journey

My passion for IT started with video games and a lot of frustration with Windows.

* Switching to Linux was a game-changer.
* I started self-hosting game servers and useful services for friends and family.
* These days Iâ€™m optimizing my homelab and diving deep into the NixOS rabbit hole.

## My Take on Tech

**Not-So-Hot Take:**

> *"If you're skilled in the terminal, you can use almost any Linux distro. The main differences are the package manager and default DE. There are exceptions, but in most cases, it's unnoticeable."*

**Hot Takes:**

> *"A computer is like air conditioning â€“ it becomes useless when you open Windows."*
> â€” Linus Torvalds

> *"Self-hosting is the only real way if you want privacy."*
> â€” Giu

## Final Thought

**Keep exploring, keep tinkering, and never stop learning.**
